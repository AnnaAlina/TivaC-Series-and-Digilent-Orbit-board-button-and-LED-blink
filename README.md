# TivaC-Series-and-Digilent-Orbit-board-button-and-LED-blink

can be described as “ an add-on board for the Texas Instruments Stellaris® LaunchPad microcontroller evaluation kit. The Orbit greatly expands the input/output capabilities of the LaunchPad, as well as introducing Digilent Pmod™ expansion connectors” [1]. Its key features include two 1x6 Digilent Pmod™ connectors, 3-axis accelerometer, 256 Kbit I 2 C EEPROM, I2C temperature sensor, 128x32 pixel OLED display, and an analog potentiometer.

Utilizing the Digilent Orbit expansion board, this code cycles through LEDs 1-4, flash when button one is pressed, and 
the red light comes on with button 2.
